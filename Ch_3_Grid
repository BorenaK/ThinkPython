''' Note: This exercise should be done using only the statements and other features we have learned so far.

    Write a function that draws a grid like the following:

+----+----+ 
|    |    | 
|    |    | 
|    |    | 
|    |    | 
+----+----+ 
|    |    | 
|    |    | 
|    |    | 
|    |    | 
+----+----+ 

Hint: to print more than one value on a line, you can print a comma-separated sequence of values: print('+', '-') By default, print advances to the next line, but you can override that behavior and put a space at the end, like this:

print('+', end=' ') 
print('-')

The output of these statements is '+ -' on the same line. The output from the next print statement would begin on the next line.
