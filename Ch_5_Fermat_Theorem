'''
Fermat’s Last Theorem says that there are no positive integers a, b, and c such that
an + bn = cn
for any values of n greater than 2.
Write a function named check_fermat that takes four parameters - a, b, c and n - and checks to see if Fermat’s theorem holds. 
If n is greater than 2 and an + bn = cn the program should print, “Holysmokes, Fermat was wrong!” Otherwise the program should print, “No, that doesn’t work.”
Write a function that prompts the user to input values for a, b, c and n, converts them to integers, and uses check_fermat to check whether they violate Fermat’s theorem.
